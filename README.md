# Week-1
E-Waste Generation Classification
This project uses the EfficientNetV2B0 deep learning model to classify images of electronic waste into 10 categories such as Mobile, Printer, Mouse, etc.
## Dataset
The dataset is organized into:
- `train/` – for training the model
- `val/` – for validation during training
- `test/` – for evaluating final accuracy
Each folder contains 10 subfolders for each class label.

## Features
- Preprocessing using TensorFlow image pipelines
- Data augmentation (flip, zoom, rotate)
- Transfer learning with EfficientNetV2B0
- Accuracy and loss visualization
- Confusion matrix and classification report
- Deployment using Gradio
